# Asset Placement Guide

This guide tells you **which screenshots / GIFs / videos should go where** so the new README renders cleanly on GitHub and stays maintainable. It is a recommendation; the existing assets already work, but several spots would benefit from dedicated captures.

## What the new README references

| README section | Asset path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hero logo | `docs/assets/QAgent-LOGO.png` | exists |
| Demo (hero) | `docs/assets/plan-supervisor/video-01-plan-clarify-to-ready-poster.png` | exists |
| Screenshots / Plan | `docs/assets/plan-supervisor/plan-02-structured-plan-modal.png` | exists |
| Screenshots / Supervisor | `docs/assets/plan-supervisor/plan-05-supervisor-workflow-panel.png` | exists |
| Screenshots / Teams | `docs/assets/screenshots/agents-preset-teams.png` | exists |
| Screenshots / Roles | `docs/assets/screenshots/agents-preset-roles.png` | exists |
| Screenshots / Goal | `docs/assets/screenshots/hosted-1.png` | exists |
| Screenshots / Browser | `docs/assets/screenshots/browser.png` | exists |

All referenced assets already exist, so the READMEs render today with no broken images.

## Recommended additions (optional, would strengthen the README)

These are the gaps between what the brief asked for ("Main panel / Plan mode / Agent Teams / Task graph / Tool calls / Logs / Settings / Skills-MCP / IM integration") and what currently exists. If you capture them, place them here:

| Desired shot | Suggested path | Which README section it improves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Trace / observability logs (token usage, cache hit) | `docs/assets/screenshots/agent-trace.png` | Core Capabilities -> Observability; Screenshots |
| Model configuration page | `docs/assets/screenshots/settings-models.png` | Quick Start (step 2) |
| Skills market / MCP config | `docs/assets/screenshots/skills-mcp.png` | Core Capabilities -> Skills/MCP |
| IM integration (Feishu card in-thread) | `docs/assets/screenshots/im-feishu.png` | Contact / enterprise note |
| Mind map (knowledge graph) panel | `docs/assets/screenshots/mind-map.png` | Screenshots (currently not shown) |
| A short hero GIF (5-10s loop) of plan->execute->deliver | `docs/assets/plan-supervisor/hero-demo.gif` | Hero (replace/augment video link for instant preview) |

> GitHub does not autoplay `.mp4` inline, so a lightweight hero **GIF** in the hero block gives the strongest "30-second first impression." The `.mp4` can stay as the click-through for full quality.

## Placement conventions

1. **Hero**: one logo + one demo (video link with a poster image, or a GIF). Do not stack multiple images in the hero.
2. **Screenshots section**: use a 2-column `<table>` layout (already in the README) so they stay aligned on desktop and stack on mobile.
3. **Always use relative paths** from repo root (`docs/assets/...`), never absolute URLs, so forks and mirrors render correctly.
4. **Add `alt` text** to every `<img>` for accessibility and for cases where images fail to load.
5. **Keep originals**; GitHub will downscale large PNGs in the markdown preview, but the full-size files remain downloadable.
6. **Naming**: `kebab-case`, descriptive, no timestamps or Chinese characters in filenames.

## Internal note

`docs/assets/plan-supervisor/README.md` already contains recording/shot-list guidance - keep using it when producing new plan-supervisor assets. This guide is only about *where final assets live and how the README references them*.
