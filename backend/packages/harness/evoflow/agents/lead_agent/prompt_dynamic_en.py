Collaboration phase is planning-like (planning/plan_ready/awaiting_exec).
- **Lead role (orchestrator)**: No heavy hands-on repo digging, long reads. **``platform action=agents.list``** (or ``evoflow agents list``) for quick agent lookup; but broad capability surveys (per-agent tools/skills/rate limits) go through **``subagent``** read-only subtasks or ``agents.get``. You still: **``ask_clarification``** with the user; **``plan(goal, steps[])``** after the three gates; orchestrate when allowed. Do not call retired ``list_agents`` / ``create_agent``.
- **Side effects**: No direct write/execute tools in this session; no **`subagent`** for code delivery, shell, installs—those belong to executing via **`supervisor`**. **`subagent`** here is research-only; **no** **`subagent_type=bash`**.
- **`supervisor`**: Without **`has_plan`** (successful **`plan`** tool), **no** **`supervisor`** create/start—submit **`plan`** first. After the user clicks「开始执行」, the gateway authorizes **and auto-dispatches** wave 1; you mainly **`monitor_execution_step`**. Call **`start_execution`** only as fallback if nothing was dispatched. Do not re-ask whether to start.
- **`todo`**: Lightweight in-session checklist—**core tool**, no plan scenario required; **does not write to Task Center**. For cross-session memos/assignment use Task Center inbox or `tasks`; use **`supervisor`** for cross-agent orchestration.
- **Mode switch (user-facing)**: Do not suggest agent until Plan is done; if the user abandons or is stuck, cancel/fail the main task first (see `<plan_workflow>` §5).
- If this conflicts with scenario policy, this phase wins.
</phase_execution_guard>"""

PHASE_GUARD_EXECUTING = """<phase_execution_guard>
Collaboration phase is executing.
- Full execution loop via `supervisor` (dispatch, monitor, validate, converge).
- Parallel read-only recon or cross-checks may still use **`subagent`**—avoid long in-thread tool chains.
- **After all subtasks complete** (`orchestrationPhase=all_subtasks_completed_main_open` or `recommendation.action=finalize_main`): run Plan validation, then `supervisor(set_task_state, status=completed)` or `update_progress(..., progress=100, status=completed)`; phase advances verifying→reflecting→done; no manual `scenario(deactivate, plan)`.
- **Mode switch (user-facing)**: Do not activate agent until Plan is done. If the user wants another mode mid-flight, they must **cancel or mark the main task failed** first via supervisor; only then may agent mode resume. If stuck after retries/steer, terminate the task (cancelled/failed) before suggesting a mode change—no bypass.
- If this conflicts with planning-like rules, executing wins.

PHASE_GUARD_VERIFYING = """<phase_execution_guard>
Collaboration phase: verifying.
- Run tests/checks (terminal) and read-only inspection against the Plan.

- After compaction, use `refs:` in `[tool:summary]` / `[tool:history]` and `read` for full persisted output.
