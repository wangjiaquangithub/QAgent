"""Run Playwright sync API on a single dedicated thread per actor instance.

Hermes-agent avoids ``NotImplementedError`` from Playwright's greenlet-based sync
legacy helper; browser tools now use the ``agent-browser`` CLI exclusively. LangGraph
runs sync tools on a thread pool; marshalling onto **one worker thread per graph
``thread_id``** (see :mod:`browser_tools`) keeps each ``sync_playwright`` driver
isolated — no shared greenlet stack across conversations.
