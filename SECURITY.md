## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to [wangjiaquan@quclouds.com](mailto:wangjiaquan@quclouds.com)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use [GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/wangjiaquangithub/QAgent/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

| Stage | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Acknowledgment | Within 48 hours |
| Initial assessment | Within 7 days |
| Fix or mitigation | Within 30 days (severity-dependent) |

## License key material (maintainers / forks)

EF3 short activation codes are verified with an HMAC key embedded as
`BUILTIN_LICENSE_CODE_MAC_B64` in `backend/packages/harness/evoflow/license/keys.py`
(overridable via `EVOFLOW_LICENSE_CODE_MAC`). **Anyone with that verification key
can forge short codes.** Ed25519 private keys must never enter the public tree
(`EVOFLOW_LICENSE_PRIVATE_KEY` / `.evoflow-license-private.key` only).

Before any public or third-party release:

1. Generate a **new** Ed25519 keypair and derived code MAC (`python -m evoflow.license.cli keygen`).
2. Ship the new public key + MAC only in builds you control; keep the private
   key in ops secrets (`EVOFLOW_LICENSE_PRIVATE_KEY`).
3. Treat any MAC/public key that was ever committed as **compromised for
   production** and rotate.

The public source-available tree ships a **community sample** keypair in `keys.py` (rotated
2026-09-11). Quclouds / commercial packages must inject production keys at build
time and must not reuse historical committed material.

Report suspected license bypasses via the channels above.

## Security Best Practices for Local Installations

Since QAgent runs as a local desktop application, users should be aware of the following:

- **API Keys**: Model API keys are stored in the local SQLite database. Ensure your machine is physically secured.
- **Network Binding**: The desktop Gateway binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only) by default — not exposed to the network.
- **Guardrails**: Tool-call guardrails are enabled by default in desktop builds to prevent dangerous operations.
- **Sandbox**: `LocalSandboxProvider` is used by default. Host bash execution is disabled unless explicitly enabled.
- **CORS**: Restricted to Tauri desktop and local dev origins by default.
- **Docker Deployments**: When using Docker, ports are mapped to `127.0.0.1` only. Do not expose ports to `0.0.0.0` unless behind a reverse proxy with authentication.

## Dependency Scanning

We recommend running periodic dependency scans:

```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install pip-audit && pip-audit

# Node.js dependencies
cd evopanel && npm audit
```
